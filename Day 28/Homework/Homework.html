    <h1>Hello, i want to tell you some interesting facts about world nature</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>Interesting Fact N1</h2>
    <p>The Universe's average colour is called 'Cosmic latte'. In a 2002 study, astronomers found that the light coming from galaxies averaged into a beige colour thats close to white.</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Interesting Fact N2</h2>
    <h4>Animals can experience time differently from humans. To smaller animals, the world around them moves more slowly compared to humans. Salamanders and lizards, for example, experience time more slowly than cats and dogs. This is because the perception of time depends on how quickly the brain can process incoming information.</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Interesting Fact N3</h2>
    <h4>All the worlds bacteria stacked on top of each other would stretch for 10 billion light-years. Together, Earth's 0.001mm-long microbes could wrap around the Milky Way over 20,000 times.</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Interesting Fact N4</h2>
    <h4>The fear of long words is called Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. The 36-letter word was first used by the Roman poet Horace in the first century BCE to criticise those writers with an unreasonable penchant for long words. It was American poet Aimee Nezheukumatathil, possibly afraid of their own surname, who coined the term how we know it in 2000.</h4>

    <h4>The worlds oldest dog lived to 29.5 years old. While the median age a dog reaches tends to be about 10-15 years, one Australian cattle dog, Bluey, survived to the ripe old age of 29.5.</h4>
